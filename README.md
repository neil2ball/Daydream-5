Daydream 5

This application generates Florida Fantasy 5 picks using the 5/36 Lotterycodex.

A list of the 36 numbers is randomized and searched for in a wheel-like fashion.

The resulting list is then printed to .jpg files for use in printing them to Florida Fantasy 5 playslips.

It is best to open the .jpg images on a computer for printing.

Florida Fantasy 5 playslips are 8.5" * 3.25" or 816px * 312px.

You will typically need to create a custom paper in your printer settings.

Printing in landscape works best.

"Shrink to fit" seems to help with sizing. There is currently some tweaking that will happen moving forward.

Despite minor alignment concerns, the printed test playslips were successfully used to purchase tickets.

On my phone, it takes about 1 minute to sort 1000 picks. all 104,976 picks took roughly over an hour.
